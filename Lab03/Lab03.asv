% La imagen pollenlow es la que tiene menor contraste, esto lo podemos ver
% a simple vista en la imagen pero también con el histograma ya que la
% diferencia entre el valor de intensidad mayor y el menor es mas pequeña
% que la de las demás imágenes.

% La imagen pollenwhite es la que tiene mayor contraste .

% 2. Write a function in Matlab to adjust the contrast of an image using 
% the above-mentioned formula and avoidiing specific Matlab functions 
% designed for this purpose. The function signature should be:
% function imadj = adjust(image)
% where image is the original image containing values in the range 
% [0.0, 1.0] and imadj is the resulting adjusted image.

%% Histogram Equalization

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1. Write a function in Matlab for computing the cumulative sum of a 
% normalized histogram. The function signature should be: 
% functioncdf = csum(hnorm) 
% where hnorm is the normalized histogram of an image and cdf is the 
% resulting cumulative sum.

a = normalize(low)

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 2. Write a function in Matlab to equalize an image using a uniform 
% transformation with 256 gray levels. The function signature should be: 
% function imageeq = equalize(image) 
% where image is the input image and imageeq is the resulting equalized 
% image. This function must use the csum function implemented in the 
% previous exercise



%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 3. Equalize the images pollenlow.jpg, pollenblack.jpg, pollenwhite.jpg 
% using the function written in the previous point. Display each resulting
% image and its corresponding histogram in figures.

low_eq = equalize(low);
black_eq = equalize(black);
white_eq = equalize(white);

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 4. Equalize the images pollenlow.jpg, pollenblack.jpg, pollenwhite.jpg 
% using the function provided by Matlab. Display the resulting images and 
% their histograms, and compare the results with the histograms computed in 
% the previous exercise.

low_eq_m = histeq(low);
black_eq_m = histeq(black);
white_eq_m = histeq(white);

figure('Name', 'Matlab equalized');
subplot(3,2,1), imshow(low_eq_m), title('low equalized');

% Este algoritmo trabaja sobre pequeñas regiones de la imagen llamadas
% "tiles", en vez de trabajar sobre la imagen completa. Esto se hace de
% manera que la región de salida coincida aproximadamente con el histograma
% especificado. Luego los "tiles" se combinan mediante la interpolación
% bilineal para eliminar los límmites inducidos artificialmente.
